1) Did their code pass their own tests?
Yes, they passed their own tests.

2) We had one distinct unusual issue that varied from the standard implementation of start files, etc.  This was that we used different books.csv files for this assignment; I used books.csv from stage 1, and they used
the one from stage 2 and 3.

3) 

test_book_identity_true
pass

test_book_identity_false
pass

test_no_exist_large_book
pass

test_no_exist_large_book2
fail
We implemented the tests/code differently; they operated saying that the id simply wasn't there, whereas
I said that there was a value error.

test_bad_author_ID
pass

test_valid_author_ID
pass

test_valid_search_text_books
pass

test_nonexistent_search_text_books
pass

test_start_year_books
fail
The different csv files meant that the code returned additional items to what my test said it should.

test_end_year_books
fail
Same "different csv files" issue.  

test_impossible_end_start_year_books
pass

test_false_start_year_books
pass

test_false_end_year_books
pass

test_sort_by_books
pass

test_book_combo
pass

test_author_identity_true
pass

test_author_identity_false
pass

test_no_exist_negative_author
pass

test_no_exist_large_author
fail
Similar to the large book example above, we implemented our code differently; they chose to just return an
empty array, I chose to raise a value error.

test_bad_book_ID
pass

test_valid_book_ID
pass

test_valid_search_text_authors
pass

test_nonexistent_search_text_authors
pass

test_start_year_end_year_authors
pass

test_impossible_end_start_year_authors
fail
This test was designed so that there couldn't be the case that an author was both living during or after
a year later than the year they were living before or during.  This case has a few interpretations; they
chose the mechanical one, in which I suppose there could be a gap in their life in which they are living
surrounding this gap.  However, I chose to treat this as an error of sorts, and thus wanted to return an
empty array. 

test_false_start_year_authors
fail
This test was designed to make sure that if the user entered a start year after 2019, it would return an
empty array because we can't guarantee someone will be alive.  However, it appears that they implemented
this delimiter so that any high start year would include "None" (ie hasn't died).

test_false_end_year_authors
pass

test_sort_by_authors_last_name
pass

test_sort_by_authors_first_name
fail
I believe they didn't actually implement sorting by first name.  

test_author_combo
pass
